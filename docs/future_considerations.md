# Future Considerations for Metaxu

## Advanced Effect Types

### Planned Effect Types
1. Resource Effect
   - Resource lifecycle management (acquire/release)
   - Automatic cleanup
   - RAII-style guarantees
   - Requires: Finalizer/destructor support

2. State Effect with Transactions
   - Atomic state updates
   - Rollback capability
   - Transaction isolation
   - Requires: Memory snapshots, rollback mechanism

3. Async Effect
   - Non-blocking operations
   - Future composition
   - Parallel execution
   - Requires: Runtime scheduler, future type

4. Error Effect
   - Structured error handling
   - Error propagation
   - Error recovery
   - Requires: Exception mechanism

## Effect Inference Features

### Type-Level Features
1. Basic Effect Inference
   - Detect effects used in functions
   - Propagate effects up call chain
   - Track effect dependencies

2. Effect Composition

   - Manage effect conflicts

3. Effect Polymorphism
   - Generic over effect types
   - Effect type constraints
   - Effect type bounds

4. Effect Regions
   - Scope-limited effects
   - Effect isolation
   - Effect masking

### Implementation Requirements

1. Type System Extensions
   - Effect type variables
   - Effect constraints
